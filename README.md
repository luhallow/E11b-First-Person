# E11b-First-Person

I feel increasingly more comfortable with creating games in Godot and in a 3D plane than I ever did making them in a 2D plane. The tutorials have made this sort of project much more interesting and much easier to follow. I'm having significantly less issues than I anticipated. The elements of the game are able to come together in my head in a smoother fashion because I can see the results at every turn.
